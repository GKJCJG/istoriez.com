## Reading to children gives cognitive advantages

In a [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775714000156) done in Australia, researchers found that children whose parents read to them not only get a better understanding for reading and language, but also get increased cognitive abilities in other areas such as mathematics. The cognivite-raising effect of parents reading to children could be seen up until at least the age of 11. So reading a bedtime story for children is a good investment!
