A Fox, swimming across a river, was barely able to reach the bank, where he laid down exhausted from his struggle with the swift current. Soon a swarm of mosquitos settled on him. But he lay quietly, still too weak to run away from them.

A Hedgehog happened by. "Let me drive the mosquitos away," he said kindly.

"No, no!" exclaimed the Fox, "do not disturb them! They have taken all they can hold. If you drive them away, another greedy swarm will come!"
